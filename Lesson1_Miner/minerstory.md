## **The Story: The Light That Guides**

**Narrator:** Tommy sat at the kitchen table, lacing up his boots for his first day in the mine. His father, James, set a worn, soot-covered lamp on the table and pulled up a chair beside him.

**Tommy:** "Never thought I’d end up in the mine, Dad. I wanted to be something more... important."

**James:** *[pausing, wiping his hands on a rag]* "Boy, you think that lamp ain’t important? This lamp has kept your granddaddy, your uncle, and me alive. It’s fed this family, put shoes on your feet, and sent you to school. Ain’t no shame in honest work."

**Tommy:** "I know, but people talk like it doesn’t matter—like we’re just a bunch of dumb hillbillies."

**James:** *[calm but firm]* "Let ‘em talk. It’s easy to look down on something when you don’t understand it. But this mine keeps the lights on—here, in their homes, and in their cities. Don’t you ever let anyone make you feel less for doing what keeps the world running."

**Narrator:** Tommy nodded, though he still looked unsure. "I just... I don’t know how you’ve done it all these years."

**James:** "You will, son. You’ll see it’s about more than coal. Now take this lamp, and remember—it’s not just a tool. It’s a reminder to stay patient, steady, and smart. And if someone calls you dumb for that, they ain’t worth listening to."

**Narrator:** Deep in the mine, Tommy worked alongside Billy and a few others. A minor collapse blocked their path, and tension rose.

**Billy:** "Let’s just clear it quick! We can’t waste time!"

**Tommy:** *[hesitant, glancing at the lamp]* "Dad said rushing is when people get hurt. We’ll do it by the book."

**Billy:** "What, scared of a little dirt?"

**Tommy:** "Better dirty than buried. Help me brace the timbers, or we’ll be here all night."

**Narrator:** With patience and teamwork, the miners cleared the blockage safely.

**Narrator:** Back at home, Tommy set the lamp on the table, exhausted but proud. James looked up from his chair, a quiet pride in his eyes.

**James:** "So, how much you pull out of that mountain today?"

**Tommy:** *[grinning]* "More than I would’ve if I’d let the roof fall in on us."

**James:** *[chuckling, clapping Tommy on the back]* "That’s my boy. Patience and smarts’ll take you further than strength ever could. You done good, son."

**Tommy:** *[pausing, voice soft]* "It’s about keeping each other safe. And uh—thanks, Dad. I didn’t know how hard it was until today. I’m lucky you did it for me."

**James:** *[smiling, holding back emotion]* "That’s what we do, son. And one day, you’ll do it for your boy. That’s how we keep the light going."
