# **Lesson: The Miner’s Lamp**

### **Instructor's Introduction**

"Today’s lesson is about the strength it takes to do hard, honest work, even when others don’t fully understand or appreciate it. Through the story of a young miner and his father, we’ll explore themes of patience and self-control—two qualities that help us navigate challenges in our work and relationships. As we go through the lesson, think about what lights your way during difficult times and how your actions can guide others, just like the miner’s lamp in our story.

We’ll start with the story, then move on to a creative activity where you’ll make your own lantern, a symbol of the light we carry to help ourselves and others. Let’s begin."
