**Coal in My Veins**  

I am my father’s calloused hands,  
the produce aisle in his bones,  
lifting crates so his children could dream  
of futures where work didn’t wear their skin thin.  

I am my best friend’s father’s lamp,  
flickering deep in the mine’s dark throat,  
his breath heavy with dust and hope,  
bringing light where the mountain threatens to swallow.  

I am my wife’s father’s hammer swing,  
the frame of a house rising steady and true,  
sweat dripping into cement like a prayer  
for shelter, for safety, for love.  

And me? I carry their fire,  
my hands full of embers passed down.  
My work doesn’t break my back—  
but don’t think it’s easy.  
Don’t think it doesn’t matter.  
Ain’t like you could do it,  
and somebody’s got to.  

I may never live to become a diamond.  
But I will endure every ounce of pressure,  
bear the weight with everything I have,  
if it takes even a moment of burden  
from my child’s back.  

And that’s the cost we pay—  
because coal burns away too quickly,  
and yeah, it burns the men up with it,  
while the damn coal barons cash the checks anyway.  
But that coal—it heats the holler.  
It keeps families fed.  
It ain’t doing any good in the ground anyway.  

But its light—  
if tended well—can forge a future free of darkness.
