**Meeting Notes: Bible Class Project Brainstorm**

**Overview**
Luke plans to create a Bible class project structured into units of seven lessons, each honoring a different type of work through a unique character. The series will explore spiritual themes rooted in labor, resilience, and the fruits of the Spirit, offering adaptable delivery formats. This brainstorm session focused on mapping occupational themes to the fruits of the Spirit and outlining initial stories and lessons.

**Structure**
- **Unit Format**: Seven lessons per unit, adaptable for delivery over 7 days, 7 weeks, 7 hours, or even 7 years.
- **Occupational Themes**: Each lesson highlights a specific type of work through a distinct character’s story.
- **Integration with Fruits of the Spirit**: The nine fruits of the Spirit from Galatians 5:22-23 are mapped to the seven occupational themes, bundling two pairs of similar fruits where necessary.

It emphasizes that children need attention and time, and that working excessive hours can limit the ability to give them the care they deserve. Love, in this context, means prioritizing presence over productivity. The lesson will be scheduled on the congregation's typical gathering day (e.g., Sunday morning service). Parents will receive instruction in the "adult" sections while children receive child-specific lessons. Each child lesson will include crafts tied to the fruits of the Spirit and a coloring activity that reflects the occupational theme of the day. The activity for the conclusion of the course will involve children presenting all the crafts they have made to their parents or caregivers, acknowledging all types of caregivers (adoptive, birth, grand, and other parental figures, such as a teacher, coach, or the kind lady at church).

**Draft Poem**
This poem was developed as a tribute to Luke’s friend’s father and serves as a thematic inspiration for the series:

**Coal in My Veins**  

I am my father’s calloused hands,  
the produce aisle in his bones,  
lifting crates so his children could dream  
of futures where work didn’t wear their skin thin.  

I am my best friend’s father’s lamp,  
flickering deep in the mine’s dark throat,  
his breath heavy with dust and hope,  
bringing light where the mountain threatens to swallow.  

I am my wife’s father’s hammer swing,  
the frame of a house rising steady and true,  
sweat dripping into cement like a prayer  
for shelter, for safety, for love.  

And me? I carry their fire,  
my hands full of embers passed down.  
My work doesn’t break my back—  
but don’t think it’s easy.  
Don’t think it doesn’t matter.  
Ain’t like you could do it,  
and somebody’s got to.  

I may never live to become a diamond.  
But I will endure every ounce of pressure,  
bear the weight with everything I have,  
if it takes even a moment of burden  
from my child’s back.  

And that’s the cost we pay—  
because coal burns away too quickly,  
and yeah, it burns the men up with it,  
while the damn coal barons cash the checks anyway.  
But that coal—it heats the holler.  
It keeps families fed.  
It ain’t doing any good in the ground anyway.  

But its light—  
if tended well—can forge a future free of darkness.

**Instructor Kit Note: "Love Them Through It"**

This is an alternate poem for consideration in adult or mature teen classes. It talks about the realities of love and marriage, and how to foster a loving relationship through hardship. It will resonate with parents as their children learn about parenthood in this module.

**Love Them Through It**  

If you love your spouse—  
and if you don’t, then leave,  
or find someone steady,  
a soul with calloused hands or a thoughtful heart,  
both if you can be so lucky,  
to help you believe again—  

But if you do,  
then love them through it.  
Even when jealousy creeps in,  
planting seeds of doubt that weren’t there.  
Even when your pride bristles  
at shadows that might not be real.  
Even when they’re not wrong—  
and you’ve known people who would be.  

Love them through it,  
because trust is the hard thing,  
the right thing.  
Because love is work,  
and you’d do anything for them,  
wouldn’t you?

**Next Steps**  
3. ***Draft a Lesson***: Fully flesh out one lesson to test the format and refine the structure.
4. ***Delivery Planning***: Determine the best initial format (e.g., small group, workshop, or digital module).
5. ***Collaborate on Coloring Sheets***: Reach out to a friend or artist to create line art for the coloring sheets associated with each lesson.
